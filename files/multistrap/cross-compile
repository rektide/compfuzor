# default architecture for dpkg-cross (to avoid always typing the -a option
# if you do cross installations only for one architecture)
# Note: default_arch is managed by debconf - it can be overridden
# if ~/.dpkg-cross/cross-compile exists or by specifying an
# architecture on the command line.
# Use '[sudo] dpkg-reconfigure dpkg-cross' to change this value.
